Description: Is able to create and sample Pair-Copula Bayesian networks (PCBN)
    under some restrictions on the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
    that is, no active cycles nor interfering v-structures.
    Furthermore, it can fit a PCBN to a data set for a fixed DAG structure; and
    it can recover the structure if unknown using a hill climbing alogrithm.
