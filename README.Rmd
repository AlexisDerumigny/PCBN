# Files that have been checked and are fully working

- File `PCBN-object.R`

   + `new_PCBN()`: working, but may be changed / developed further.
   So the API is still not stable.
   
   + `plot.PCBN()` and `print.PCBN()` are working but are somehow basic and
   can be improved.

- File `Simulation.R`

   + `sample_PCBN()`
   + `compute_sample_margin()`
   
   Both functions are finished, but will return an error if the PCBN does not
   satisfy the restrictions. This is the case for example if the order of the
   parents are not chosen in the correct way (even though the graph may not
   have any active cycle nor interfering v-structure).


# Plan for future work

- File `tag_PCBN.R` : to be deleted.

- File `Estimation.R` : rewriting in progress.


## Files to be checked soon

- File `Hill_climbing.R`


## Files to be checked and rearranged

- File `CopulaAssignement.R`

   + `is_cond_copula_specified()` and `find_cond_copula_specified()`
   are already checked and working.

- File `functions.R`

- File `Graph.R`

   + `remove_CondInd()` is already checked and working.

- File `Utilities.R`


## Other files to be checked later

- File `Density_PCBN.R`
   
- File `Performance_metrics.R`

- File `Random_PCBN.R`
